## Description

PolyVille Active is a digital tool aimed at local authorities, residents and shopkeepers whose aim is to make cities more dynamic by bringing together the major players in the city. The essential is to inform about activities, promotions, dates not to be missed, the creation of new local shops, parking spaces and public transport. The front-end application was built using Angular and Angular Material. The back-end application was conceived using Java, PF4J, and the Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA). The back-end has been designed as a collection of plugins. Each plugin can extend the functionality of the others or define new extension points. In addition, each plugin can define a new API or consume an external API. Finally, plugins can be enabled or disabled at runtime from the front-end application.
